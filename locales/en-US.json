Curious and having the will to learn, I like to discover and get involved in new areas of technology: digital imaging, artificial intelligence, web, embedded systems, etc... My long-term ambition is to work in a sector that I particularly like: aerospace. Indeed, having always been passionate about the stars, I want to participate in the development of humanity in space.",
