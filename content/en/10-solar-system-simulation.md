# Context
The Solar System Simulation project is a Python-based homework assignment focused on simulating the physics of celestial bodies within our solar system. The project aims to create an accurate simulation using real data and employs various libraries such as PyImGUI, PyOpenGL, and GLFW.

# Presentation
The Solar System Simulation project provides an interactive visualization of the solar system. The application allows users to configure various settings related to the system, animation, and rendering. The simulation accurately represents the planets' positions, sizes, and colors based on real data obtained from the NASA website. Users can zoom in and out, change the radius scale, and customize the appearance of each celestial body. Additionally, a performance profiler is included to monitor the rendering and physics engines' performance.
