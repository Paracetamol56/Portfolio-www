# Context
Ce-que-vous-voulez is an iOS mobile application that I developed in Swift. This project was created during my time in school and serves as a showcase of my skills and knowledge. It is important to note that Ce-que-vous-voulez is not intended for production use, but rather as a demonstration of my ability to leverage APIs and create functional mobile applications (even if I don't want to do it professionally, it's just for fun).

# Presentation
Ce-que-vous-voulez offers a range of features designed to enhance the user's movie-watching experience. The home screen provides a curated list of the most popular and highly rated movies of the moment, allowing users to stay up-to-date with the latest trends. The category list enables users to explore different movie genres and navigate through pages of each category effortlessly. Additionally, users can access detailed information about movies, including posters, titles, subtitles, ratings, release dates, running times, genres, and synopses. The application also allows users to watch movie trailers and conveniently search for specific movies. Lastly, Ce-que-vous-voulez includes a cinema map feature, which displays a map of nearby theaters, enabling users to locate their preferred cinema easily.

# Level up
<ul><li>Proficiently developed an iOS mobile application using Swift</li><li>Demonstrated proficiency in integrating external APIs</li><li>Implemented a user-friendly interface with multiple screens, incorporating features such as movie search, category browsing, and video playback</li></ul>

# Conclusion
Overall, I liked the Swift language, some features are similar to other modern languages like Rust, which I really like. However, I had trouble dealing with the Apple ecosystem. Xcode offers some good features, but I was disappointed that the environment is so closed and proprietary, and that you can't benefit from third-party tools. In a nutshell, I was happy to discover this language and build this mobile application. But as a daily Linux user and open source enthusiast, I didn't like the environment at all.
