# Presentation
Longue-vue is a web application that I created during my internship at the end of my DUT. Its objective is to offer a support to help high school students in their choice of orientation.

# The internship
I did my internship in the Quebec company Cosmoss La Matanie which has the mission to accompany children from early childhood to professional integration.<br/>I was the only developer on the project, so it was up to me to organize the ideas and needs of the company and then implement them in the final product.

# Timeline
I started by thinking about the structure of the application. Since it is a hub of activities and resources, it was important to get the user experience right. According to the clients, sections quickly emerged. So I started to design the interface and integrate basic components (texts, buttons, login interface, etc.) while learning the philosophy of the Vue.js framework. Very quickly, I needed to tackle the backend. The company strongly advised me to use Firebase for the reduced costs (on a small scale) and for the speed of development. I continued to work all along the internship with the agile method on the backend and the frontend in parallel.

# Continuation of the project
It was expected that the project would not be finalized in time, but the goal was to provide a functional basis<br/>The project was handed over to a specialized company to continue the work started. The application aspires to be used in many schools in Quebec.

# Level up
<ul><li>Web development with the Vue.js framework</li><li>NoSQL database management</li><li>Project management, communication with clients</li></ul>

# Conclusion
This project was very rich in learning in the web domain that I didn't know enough before my internship. In the end, I am very proud of the result and it is really motivating to think that this application will be continued and used to help students.
