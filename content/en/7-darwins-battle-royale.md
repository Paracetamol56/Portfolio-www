# Presentation
This project is a "zero player game" or "self played game" (like Conway's game), i.e. the player only selects the initial situation. t is an evolutionary artificial intelligence project: the experience is repeated over several generations and each generation takes advantage of the previous one with certain possible mutations.<br/>It is a 3D environment in which creatures evolve. Each creature's goal is to kill the others through hand-to-hand combat and the creature that is last to remain wins.
