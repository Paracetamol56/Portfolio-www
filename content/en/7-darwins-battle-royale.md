# Presentation

This project is a "zero player game" or "self played game" (like Conway's game), the player only selects the initial situation. It is an evolutionary artificial intelligence project: the experience is repeated over several generations, and each generation takes advantage of the previous one with certain possible mutations.
It is a 3D environment in which creatures evolve. Each creature's goal is to kill the others through hand-to-hand combat, and the creature that is last to remain wins.

# Level up

- Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Reinforcement Learning
- AI-Driven Video Game Development
- Solo Project Management (Daily scrums, feature writing, written notes, etcâ€¦)
