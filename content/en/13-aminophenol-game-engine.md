# Presentation

Aminophenol is a 3D game engine written in C++17 with the Vulkan graphics API. The aim of this project is to familiarize myself with the basic concepts of a game engine and to give me a better understanding of how modern game engines work. The engine is currently under development and not yet ready for use. Eventually, this engine could be used as a canvas for real-time 3D projects, but the main objective is educational.

# Level up

- Learn about the Vulkan graphics API
- Learn the basic concepts of a game engine
- Modern C++
