# Problem

There are several catalogs of deep sky objects (Messier, NGC, Herschel, IC, etcâ€¦). However, these catalogs are often huge and difficult to sort according to the time of year, the instruments at disposition or even the preferences of each.

# Features

The Observeur2 should be a simple interface to view, modify or create a personalized database for each astronomer. However, this database should be sufficiently complete to meet practical needs. For example, visibility objects in relation to the seasons. The software must also know the position of the observer to adapt the content.

# Sharing

The database must be contained in an unencrypted file to allow sharing between several people easily.

# Level up

- Mastery of the QT Framework
- Use of local SQLite databases
- Development of complex astronomical algorithms

# Conclusion

I am very satisfied with the functionalities offered by the software even if there is still a lot to do before it can be distributed.
A version for the web could be an option for the future.
