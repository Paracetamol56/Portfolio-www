# Presentation

This project is an airplane game similar to Flight Simulator. The plane is quite realistic without being too difficult to handle.
The map is generated procedurally, so the landscapes is not always the same.
For the gameplay, the game offers 3 game modes:

- Free mode lets you explore the map as much as you want.
- Delivery mode: you must transport goods and deliver them from the air to a set target
- Canadair mode: the player must drop water to put out fires

# Timeline

For this project, we used the agile method and we divided our 2 months of development into 3 sprints.
First of all, I was responsible for implementing the flight controller so that the aircraft would be functional. This was the core functionality of the project, on which all other parts of the development were based.
Then I continued to implement features to my controller to respect all the behaviors of a real plane.
Finally, I participated in the programming of the gameplay with the canadair game mode.

# Level up

- Mastery of Unity 3D
- Teamwork with the agile method

# Conclusion

I really liked the simulation aspect of this project, in addition, working with a team of this size was a new experience for me and I am very happy with the organization and the atmosphere of work that we have managed to establish.
