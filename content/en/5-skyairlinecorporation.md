# Presentation
This project is an airplane game similar to Flight Simulator. The plane is quite realistic without being too difficult to handle.<br/>The map is generated procedurally, so that that the landscapes are not always the same.<br/>For the gameplay, the game offers 3 game modes:<ul><li>Free mode: the player can explore the map as much as he wishes</li ><li>Delivery mode: the player must transport goods and deliver them from the air to a set target</li><li>Canadair mode: the player must drop water to put out fires</li></ul><br/>My role in the team was responsible for the development, I was responsible for ensuring that the code generated by the team members was uniform and organized, I also supervised the use from git.

# Timeline
For this project, we used the agile method and we divided our 2 months of development into 3 sprints.<br/>First, I was in charge of implementing the flight controller so that the planes are functional. It was a central feature of the project on which all other parts of the development relied.<br/>Then I continued to implement features to my controller to respect all the behaviors of a real plane.<br/>Finally, I participated in the programming of the gameplay with the canadair game mode.

# Level up
<ul><li>Mastery of Unity 3D</li><li>Teamwork with the agile method</li></ul>

# Conclusion
I really liked the simulation aspect of this project, in addition, working with a team of this size was a new experience for me and I am very happy with the organization and the atmosphere of work that we have managed to establish.
