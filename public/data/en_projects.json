			"Context": "That level again is a mobile game whose first opus was released in 2016 on Android and iOS. The game is seemingly simple: platforms, a door and a button but it is better not to trust appearances Indeed, the game will use your logic to pass the same level in an increasingly improbable way.<br/>For my first 2D game in Unity, I have therefore decided to recreate 12 of the 96 original levels.",
			"Timeline": "The first step was of course the creation of assets. From the animation of the stickman character to the user interfaces and the backgrounds, all the assets were recreated by me with some freedom from the game original.<br/>I then had to design the basic mechanics: the control of the character, the different necklaces, etc. Child's play with the Unity interface and the different models that already exist.<br/> Finally, the part that required me the most patience: programming the behavior of the different elements according to the level. As there are 12 levels, and none are identical, you have to recode for each level the interactions between the player, the button, the door and sometimes even the decor.",
			"Level up": "<ul><li>Creating assets</li><li>Basic knowledge of Unity 2D (Character, scenery, level system)</li><li>Editing scripts in C# in the Unity environment</li></ul>",
			"Conclusion": "I am finally very proud of the result for a first game. I find the game enjoyable despite some remaining bugs."

			"Introduction": "E428 is a 2D pixel art platformer developed on Unity in which the player takes on the character of Glucose, a slime made from corn syrup that escaped from its production line in a food factory. On his journey to get out of the factory and maybe regain his freedom, glucose will encounter all kinds of creatures and machines that he will have to fight or that will help him learn more about the factory and its the events that take place within.",
			"Timeline": "My role in the project was to create the environment assets and the level design.<br>In the game, the character evolves through 4 levels each with a particular atmosphere (colors, lights, objects, etc. …) I therefore made 4 different sets of assets for each level.<br>Then came the time to integrate these assets into the game engine. As I was dealing with “static” environment assets, I used Unity's tilesheet system to make the level design work much easier. Some assets are purely decorative but others are physical and therefore require the use of collars.<br>Finally, I loaded myself the level design of 2 of the 4 levels of the game in accordance with the decisions of the team to best reflect the atmosphere that we wanted to give to the game.<br>At the same time, I was in charge of project management , especially with git so that all members of the group can have the project in its most recent version and be able to modify his game.",

			"Conclusion": "Even if I didn't take too much care of the development part, I nevertheless learned a lot about the creation of video games and I was able to progress on aspects complementary to the code."
